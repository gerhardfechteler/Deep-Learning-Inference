# Deep-Learning-Inference

The module MLP_module implements the algorithms presented in the paper "Marginal Effect based Inference in the Deep Learning Framework", soon available on arXiv. The link will be added here.

MLP_module contains the class MLP for training a multilayer perceptron, making predictions, computing marginal effects and estimating confidence intervals for the marginal effects. 

Methods available to the user:
- train: trains an MLP with the specified architecture and given data.
- compute_ME: computes the marginal effects after training.
- compute_ME_std: computes the asymptotic conditional standard deviations of the marginal effect estimator after training.
- predict: predicts the dependent varibles for provided regressors
- compute_ME_CI_boot: trains an MLP with the specified architecture and given data, returns the average marginal effects and their confidence intervals.

The methods compute_ME, compute_ME_std and predict can be used only after running the method train. The method compute_ME_CI can be used directly.

The file example.py shows how to use the module.
